    "With an increase in traffic congestion and drivers on the road, San Diego is seeing a spike in road incidents. There is a growing concern, especially considering how the district attorney's office has prosecuted 225 fatal cases for driving under the influence (DUIs) over the past 10 years since 2023. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Many institutions are looking into the issue, with UC San Diego's Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science leading a program to make roads safer for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. This effort is supported by a $360,000 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety through the NHTSA. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) With the increase in accidents comes the question how this varies among different types of vehicles, makes, and models. According to the Times of San Diego, distracted driving, speeding, and DUIs are cited as the primary causes of accidents in the region.  <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Exploring these distributions could unveil specific focus groups or brands associated with accidents, providing invaluable insights into real-world traffic occurrences and vehicular accidents. An analysis of car accident data from 2017 to 2022 also sheds light on the variations in accident occurrences. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Specific types of violations, such as failure to yield or unsafe turns may additionally demonstrate distinct patterns that may be influenced by vehicle characteristics and driving behaviors. Understanding these nuances is essential for informing policies and strategies that effectively address the occurrence of specific types of accidents and promote road safety for all road users."

    "1. The ideal dataset\n",
    "    - The ideal dataset should include the cause of a traffic collision, vehicle makes, and vehicle models in San Diego so that we can answer our primary research question. Then, to answer our sub-questions, it would be nice if there is an indication of the severity of a collision that we can utilize such as the number of people who got injured or the amount of damage on vehicles. Additionally, to do geospatial analysis, it would be nice to have where each collision occurred. To examine frequency correctly, it would be ideal if there is a government organization that keeps all the traffic collision records that we can use. If this is the case, it's likely to be that the data is recorded by different police officers across different regions of San Diego. Some might use different abbreviations for collision causes and some might exclude some information such as specifying the exact model type. So we shouldn't expect 100% accuracy on the recorded data and explore this area during our EDA.\n",

Some other potentially useful columns we will use include the year and the location for exploration on aggregation on potential differences in the distribution based on the results we get from our main question. We also have an injured and killed count for further exploration into the severity of accidents. Note this data was already cleaned based on certain choices made to exclude, including person role in accident and the specific violation section. These exclusions were mainly chosen due to believed irrelevance to our current goals. One particular column of interest is the 'person_veh_type' column removed. Some of this information is useful (it points out potential SUVs and jeeps for vehicle shape types for example) but the information is currently too messy and still contains large amounts of irrelevant/less helpful data labels along with missing values.
