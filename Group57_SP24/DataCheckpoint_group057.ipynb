    "With an increase in traffic congestion and drivers on the road, San Diego is seeing a spike in road incidents. There is a growing concern, especially considering how the district attorney's office has prosecuted 225 fatal cases for driving under the influence (DUIs) over the past 10 years since 2023. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Many institutions are looking into the issue, with UC San Diego's Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science leading a program to make roads safer for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists. This effort is supported by a $360,000 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety through the NHTSA. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) With the increase in accidents comes the question how this varies among different types of vehicles, makes, and models. According to the Times of San Diego, distracted driving, speeding, and DUIs are cited as the primary causes of accidents in the region.  <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Exploring these distributions could unveil specific focus groups or brands associated with accidents, providing invaluable insights into real-world traffic occurrences and vehicular accidents. Prior research has hinted at this connection. A study published in the Journal of Social Marketing found that certain car brands were statistically more likely to be involved in accidents where risky or aggressive maneuvers were a factor. The lead author of the study, Alan Tapp, highlighted the role of marketing in promoting certain images associated with driving, such as performance and speed prevalent with more luxury vehicles. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) An analysis of car accident data from 2017 to 2022 also sheds light on the variations in accident occurrences. <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Specific types of violations, such as failure to yield or unsafe turns may additionally demonstrate distinct patterns that may be influenced by vehicle characteristics and driving behaviors. Understanding these nuances is essential for informing policies and strategies that effectively address the occurrence of specific types of accidents and promote road safety for all road users."

    "**We believe that car brands favored by younger generations or falling under the higher luxury/sport categories are more likely to be involved in collision accidents.** The former is believed due to the idea that younger individuals will simply have less experience in driving and hence, they are more likely to get into collision accidents. Additionally, luxury/sportier cars also tend to exhibit higher-power engines but in turn make them harder to control, which increases the likelihood of these vehicle drivers getting into a collision accident. Our observations would suggest that speeding and making unsafe turns are the most prevalent factors for incidents in San Diego overall as well as for vehicles classified in the luxury/sport category. This was information we made note of directly from the highest occurrences of individual violations in our dataset, backing up our previous point on young generations since we believe there’s a larger recklessness involved with their driving, which would include going at unsafe levels of speed and making high risk turns. Another factor we believe to prevalent toward reasoning would be DUIs, as since we expect the larger majority of drivers to be on the younger side, we also believe that this age group would have less tolerance in regards to alcohol consumption and combined with the consideration of less responsiblity expected from this group may be more likely to commit to driving under influence."

    "Dataset #1 is maintained by the City of San Diego, and it contains traffic collisions reported to San Diego Police Department. Important columns are date and time, person's injury level, vehicle make, vehicle model, location, vehicle violation section, charge description, and number of people who got injured and killed. For date and time, it is in string format that includes year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, and it ranges from 2015 to 2024. For a person's injury level, it is categorized as uncertain, pain, severe, and fatal with some null values. For vehicle make and model, it is stored as strings. However, since the data was recorded by humans, there are some missing values since they might not be able to identify all kinds of vehicles. For location, we can use `police_beat`, which is in integer, to merge with another dataframe that has a mapping of police beat and city name so that we can get the location name into something we are familiar with. The vehicle violation section is stored as a string indicating which California vehicle violation section a driver violated. This is related to the charge description column, which is in string. So using the charge description, we can get a sense of what each violation section code means by using text analysis. Through this, we can understand why an accident occurred for each row. For the number of people who got injured and killed, they are stored as integers each ranging from 0 to 122 and 0 to 3. We could also use this to approximate how severe an accident was. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #2 is maintained by the California Energy Commission, and it is about Zero Emission Vehicles Sales in California. It contains year, quarter, county, fuel type, make, model, and number of vehicles. The year column is in integer ranging from 2009 to 2024. The Quarter column is in string, and the values are Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. County is also in a string value, and since it contains all counties in California, we will later filter it by San Diego. Next, the fuel type column contains 3 types of string values which are electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and hydrogen. For vehicle make and model, they are also in string. **Later, we can use these columns and the year column to merge with our first dataset so that we can normalize observations based on the sales to account for different proportions of existing vehicle makes in San Diego.** For the number of vehicles, it stores integers ranging from 1 to 4669. Its mean value is 124 with a median value of 33. So we can tell the distribution is skewed to the right. \n",

    "The crux of the data here covers all vehicle accidents in San Diego from 2015 to present. This data set is grouped to cover all types of brands and the collisions accidents they got into a singular dataframe. The most important sections will be brand and accident type (found under 'charge_desc') which will be the crux behind the true exploration of the data. Some other potentially useful columns we will use include the year and the location for exploration on aggregation on potential differences in the distribution based on the results we get from our main question. We also have an injured and killed count for further exploration into the severity of accidents.\n",

    "A simple summary of the cleaning process is as follows; first all string formatting was lowered and title for better presentations. Some exceptions included model brand and type since we felt changin the string to lower wouldn't really do much in terms of presentations and the upper cases here helped highlight the specific type of brand, model, etc. of the vehicle. Police beats codes were replaced with the actual district number from the csv dictionary reference if it existed else unknown, and time reported was changed to datetime per pandas along with extracting the year in specific. Street addresses were concatenate to a single full name column and seperating columsn were dropped. The same was done on interesection street addresses if they existed along a column labeling whether the collision occured at any intersection or not. Finally the data was filtered to only driver roles due to interest in only collisions caused by drivers and reports from 2016 and 2015 were dropped due to extremly low amounts. Missing value columns were replaced appropiate will \"missing\" text or \"not applicable\" depending on the column context. Finally, merge was commited on violation_section with a seperate dataframe to include a description column on the specific violation. "

As such, the main reason for the usage of this frame here was to help us identify vehicles purchased in san diego and connect them to possible collision models we found in our previous dataset.
